# AI-and-Data-Mining
AI and Data Mining Project with Python
Information retrieval project
Sentiment classification
The project is about sentiment (text classification) and is used to identify positive and negative sentiments from sentences written by users. It is written with Python code and in Anaconda environment. It should be mentioned that in this code, 1 means positive and 0 means negative.
The files related to the program code and output are attached
The steps of performing the data mining algorithm for text classification:
1.	Download the train and test text files from the Kaggle site
2.	Converting the files to CSV format and separating the train file into two features (matn, class)
3.	Reading csv file and converting to array
4.	Applying preprocessing steps such as solving encoding problems and...
5.	Dividing the data set train into two parts (2/3 for training including 4600 data and 1/3 for testing including 2300 algorithm accuracy data)
6.	Use NBclassifier
7.	getAccuracy=96%
8.	Reading the test file in csv format (33000instances)
9.	Applying the NBclassifyer algorithm and obtaining labels related to data
10.	Write the relevant information in the text file
